### <span style="color: white; background-color: #369574;">Where and when?</span>

We meet **monthly**, the second Thursday of every month at 4pm UTC. Also **virtually**, both due to ongoing travel restrictions and because virtual meetings allow participants to easily join from different parts of the world. 

Sessions are hosted & facilitated by [Julieta Arancio](https://drexel.edu/coas/faculty-research/faculty-directory/postdocs/arancio-julieta/). The session notes will be shared openly in this website. The meetings will be run in English, and the [GOSH code of conduct](https://openhardware.science/gosh-2017/gosh-code-of-conduct/) will apply.  

Our first meeting was held on Dec. 2, 2021. You can find all meeting notes in [the archive](meeting-archive.md).
