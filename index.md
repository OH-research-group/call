### <span style="color: white; background-color: #369574;">The basics</span>

<b>*What is open hardware and why it is important to know more about it?*</b>

Although the number of research projects and available academic literature in open hardware is growing, research on the non-technical aspects of the practice is still scarce. Grassroots communities like the Gathering for Open Science Hardware [acknowledge this gap](https://openhardware.science/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GOSH-roadmap-smll.pdf), highlighting the need for a collaborative research agenda that includes the multiple and diverse aspects of open hardware practice. 

Some of the areas explored by early work comprise the study of collaboration dynamics in open hardware projects, analysis of documentation quality and use of licenses, business models in contrast with open-source software, and documentation of experiences with open hardware in citizen science. More recently, a stream of literature addresses policy recommendations for institutions, science funders and governments at the national level.  

Studies on the “meta” of open hardware can be found in the crossroads of multiple disciplines: design science, human-computer interaction (HCI), open innovation, pedagogical research, science and technology studies (STS). Research is done in academic settings but also carried out by non-profits; the diversity of approaches, however, has not yet accumulated into a coherent body of knowledge.

<b>*Why a research community on open hardware?*</b>

Sustaining an open, collaborative community of researchers on the topic would provide a much-needed forum for discussing the foundational aspects of open hardware as a field of study. Discussions amongst researchers would shed light over common and divergent framings and methods in the field, while facilitating learning from each other's experience. 

Becoming a reference community for meta-research on open hardware can also contribute to increasing the impact of ongoing work. Connections with communities of practitioners can better inform research leading to more useful results; policy efforts usually demand evidence-based insights. 

The various disciplines, backgrounds and approaches converging in the study of open hardware constitute an opportunity to shape the field towards the future. It is a chance to intentionally create a space for researchers anywhere in the world, and from a diversity of backgrounds, to share their work and ideas for the field. 
<br>

<b>*Who is it for, and why should you join?*</b>

The group is open to researchers both inside and outside academia (independents, working at non-profits, community-based) in any part of the world, studying aspects of open hardware practice that do not fall into development, testing or maintenance of open hardware. The scope is wide, if you are in doubt, just ask :)

Research networking has been recognized as a positive activity that enables shared learning, new research opportunities, establishing new research projects, joint applications for funds, increased visibility and impact of work, among others. One of the first conversations we will have will deal with the expectations of researchers joining the community, and how can we work together to achieve them.  
<br>
<b>*What will we be doing?*</b>

This is another question to explore collaboratively, based on ongoing work of members of the community. Some tentative lines of work include: 

- mapping available research and detecting vacancy areas,  
- connecting ongoing research with practitioners and policy makers in our networks,  
- presenting our work so we can learn from each other,  
- applying for funds for meta research on open hardware,  
- publishing a collection of articles at the Journal of Open Hardware 
- any other one we come up with.


### <span style="color: white; background-color: #369574;">Where and when?</span>

Initially we will meet **virtually**, both due to ongoing travel restrictions and because virtual meetings allow participants to easily join from different parts of the world. The proposed frequency is to have **a monthly meeting**, though this is open to discussion with members of the community. 

Sessions will be hosted & facilitated by [Julieta Arancio](https://drexel.edu/coas/faculty-research/faculty-directory/postdocs/arancio-julieta/). The session notes will be shared openly in this website. The meetings will be run in English, and the [GOSH code of conduct](https://openhardware.science/gosh-2017/gosh-code-of-conduct/) will apply.  

We are planning our first meeting for the **first week of November 2021**.
