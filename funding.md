## Funding opportunities for open hardware researchers

<details>
  <summary><b>Code for Science and Society - 2022 Event Fund (Deadline January 18, 2022)</b></summary>
  
<br>The Event Fund, established in 2020, offers grant funding (up to 20K USD), a cohort-based networking experience, and training opportunities for event organizers in data science (expansively defined) to support the building of new relations.<br><br>
  
Applications should demonstrate the educational and scientific purposes of the proposed event (or series of events) and specifically how it advances Code for Science & Societyâ€™s goal to create inclusive knowledge-sharing spaces and support the development of diverse leaders. Proposals should also demonstrate how their proposed format (virtual, in-person, hybrid) aligns with their proposed event goals. We aim to invest in emerging or established events that demonstrate a commitment to making science inclusive and accessible.<br><br>

Applications from all parts of the globe are encouraged, as well as proposals for events held in non-English languages. Applicants are encouraged to make use of resources that provide information on and support for best practices in conference planning and to review guidance on a strong application and frequently asked questions about the application process.<br><br>
