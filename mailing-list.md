# How-to mailing list

The main communication channel for the group, when we are not at the periodic meeting, is a mailing list hosted at University of Bath.

The mailing list homepage is [https://lists.bath.ac.uk/sympa/info/oh-research](https://lists.bath.ac.uk/sympa/info/oh-research)

That's an important link, as from the homepage you can subscribe, unsubscribe and change your mailing preferences.

## How to send a message to the list

Only subscribers can post messages to the list. 

To send a message, you just have to create a new email from your registered address, and send it to [oh-research@lists.bath.ac.uk](mailto:oh-research@lists.bath.ac.uk)

## Replying to a message someone sent to the list

If you want to reply to a message someone sent to the list, directly hit reply in your email client. By default, this will automatically add two destinataries: the list, and the original sender.

> **Important**: if you want to send a private reply to the original sender, make sure you delete the list address! If not your reply will go to all list subscribers.

## Checking the messages archive

You can see all messages sent to the list from the list homepage. Go to [https://lists.bath.ac.uk/sympa/info/oh-research](https://lists.bath.ac.uk/sympa/info/oh-research) and click on `Archive`.

1. Go to the list homepage 
2. Open the Log-in menu in the upper right corner

Once in the subscriber options page, you can: 
1. Change your name
2. Update your email address
3. Update how you receive your email: by default the option is "standard", which gets you one email per message sent to the list; you can change this to "summary", which will send you one email per week, every Friday at 10 am, with the list of messages.

This is how the summary looks like, if you click each link under the numbered list it will take you to the respective message:
